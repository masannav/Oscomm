osCommerce 2.2 Orders Update Script

This script is used to insert the order total values into
a new orders_total table used by the new order class and
order_total modules.

Before running the update on a live server, it is
recommended to "test-run" the process on a test or backup
database dump.

If you are not happy with the results the first time you
run the update script, you may delete the orders_total
table contents and run the process again using different
parameter values.

Once you are happy with the results, you should remove
two columns from the orders table, which are
shipping_method and shipping_cost, with the following
sql queries:

alter table orders drop shipping_method;
alter table orders drop shipping_cost;
